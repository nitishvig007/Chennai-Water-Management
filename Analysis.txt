1. Below data tells about the area and year where rainfall exceeded level limits.
* 2004 and 2017 : heavy rainfall in all regions
* 2005 : heavy rainfall in Cholavaram, Chembarambakkam and Poondi
* 2015 : heavy rainfall in Redhills
* 2018 : heavy rainfall in Poondi
2. For Poondi region, maximum rainfall occured for 8 days in August, 16 days in September, 6 days in October
	For Chembarambakkam region, maximum rainfall occured for 9 days in May, July and August, 25 days in September, 17 days in October
	For Cholavaram region, maximum rainfall occured for 7 days in July and August, 25 days in September, 6 days in June, 17 days in October
	For Redhills region, maximum rainfall occured for 11 days in August, 16 days in September, 20 days in October

3. Here we have trained our model to predict weather we have to take precaution of reservoir level, handling depending on the month and it's level, rainfall parameters




Conclusion : 

1. KNN(accuracy = 0.98) is giving the best result for our dataset(taking only rainfall_level csv file) ,ie, to predict weather to take precation for exceeded rainfall
2. Decision Tree(accuracy = 0.99) is giving the best result for our dataset(taking only reservoir_level and reservoir_rainfall csv file) ,ie, to predict weather to take precation for exceeded rainfall
3. We used Decision Tree Classifier to get the results with tuned parameters that gave us the accuracy of 0.990265, AUC = 0.814
